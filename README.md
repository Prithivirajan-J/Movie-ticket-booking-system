# Movie Ticket Booking System

This is a simple web-based movie ticket booking system built using Streamlit and SQLite. It allows users to sign up, log in, select movies and showtimes, and book seats through an interactive grid layout (A1 to E5). Booked seats are stored in a local SQLite database and are visually disabled to prevent double booking. Users can also view their booking history.

## Project Overview

- Built using Python and Streamlit for a quick, interactive UI.
- Uses SQLite to store user credentials and booking details.
- Displays a 5x5 seat grid that shows real-time availability.
- Enables user authentication, seat booking, and viewing of personal booking history.
